                Hi and welcome to the stormlight characters archive! 
                I created this site as a simple in-class exercise while I was learning to hone my coding skills. 
                I continued to passively work on this site in my pass time and it's still a work in progress for sure. 
                I don't take any credit for the artwork, as those are simply images found online, and linked from those sites. 
            </p>
            <p className='aboutMe'>
                I have a passion for coding, and learning new things.
                Fortunately, in the world of software engineering, there is no limit on the things I can read. 
                I've truely found my passion. 
                Although this site is simple in nature, I remain proud of myself for the leaps and bounds I took to get to this point. 
                If you have a passion for problem solving, logic, and building new things, 
                then I highly suggest you look into coding too!
